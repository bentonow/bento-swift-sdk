The Bento Swift SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent analytics experience in your iOS application. We provide powerful and customizable APIs that can be used out-of-the-box to track your users' behavior and manage subscribers. We also expose low-level APIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

Get started with our [📚 integration guides](https://docs.bentonow.com/) and [example projects](https://github.com/bentonow/), or [📘 browse the SDK reference](https://docs.bentonow.com/subscribers).

> Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [migration guide](https://github.com/bentonow/bento-swift-sdk/blob/master/MIGRATING.md) and [changelog](https://github.com/bentonow/bento-swift-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Thread Safety

All API methods are designed to be called from any thread. The completion handlers are always called on the main thread, making it safe to update your UI directly from within the completion handler.
